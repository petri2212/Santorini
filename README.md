Santorini is an abstract strategy board game for 2-4 players designed by Gordon Hamilton in 1985. The game is played on a grid where each turn players build a town by placing building pieces up to three levels high. To win the game, players must move one of their two characters to the third level of the town. This project is about the digitalization of the game taking advantage of object programming in Java.
